# Variables
# remember algebra
# teacher says x = 1, so what is 2x?
# you will say ah ok it's 2 because x + x = 1 + 1 = 2

# no need to use var/let/const

# Variables have no quotation marks
name = "your name"
print(name) # your name

age = 20 # your age
print(age) # (remember no quotation marks for integer)

print(age > 18)
print(name == "your name")

# Imagine a reservation is made at a bar
# The bar has a robot
# robot checks for age, and identity
print (age >= 18 and name == "your name")
