# Mathematical and logical operators in python
print (10 + 20)
print (20 - 10)
print (20 * 10)
print (20 / 10) # Division always gives a float

# Exponent
print (10 ** 20)

# Modulos - operations that gives you the remainder of a division
print (20 % 2) # 0 because no remainder
print (20 % 3) # 2 because 2 is the remainder

# Logical operations
# 10 > 3 is True
# 3 > 10 is False
# 3 > 3 is False

# > More than
# >= More than OR equals to
# < Less than
# <= Less than OR equals to 
# == equals to 
# != not equals to 

# AND / OR / NOT  Function

# AND
# True and True is True
# True and False is False
